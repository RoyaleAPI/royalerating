# Royale Rating

**Royale Rating** (RR), developed by [RoyaleAPI](https://royaleapi.com), aims to give each player a score related to their skill. The rating system tackles several disadvantage of Elo and is able to quickly hone into an individualâ€™s true skill rating in a short amount of time. Additionally, the system can calculate ratings for individual players even when they participate in multi-player settings, e.g. 2v2 and more.
